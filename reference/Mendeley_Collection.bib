abstract={ This paper examines the theoretical aspects of bandwidth sharing in wireless, possibly mobile, ad-hoc networks (MANETs) through a game theoretic framework. It presents some applications to show how such a framework can be invoked to design efficient media access control protocols in a noncooperative, self-organized, topology-blind environment as well as in environments where the competing nodes share some basic information to guide their choice of channel access policies. For this purpose, contentions between concurrent links in a MANET are represented by a conflict graph, and each maximal clique in the graph defines a contention context which in turn imposes a constraint on the share of bandwidth that the links in the clique can obtain. Using this approach the fair bandwidth allocation problem is modeled as a general utility based constrained maximization problem, called the system problem, which is shown to admit a unique solution that can only be obtained when global coordination between all links is possible. By using Lagrange relaxation and duality theory, both a non-cooperative and a cooperative game formulation of the problem are derived. The corresponding mathematical algorithms to solve the two games are also provided where there is no need for global information. Implementation issues of the algorithms are also considered. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

abstract={ In self-organizing ad hoc networks, all the networking functions rely on the contribution of the participants. As a basic example, nodes have to forward packets for each other in order to enable multihop communication. In recent years, incentive mechanisms have been proposed to give nodes incentive to cooperate, especially in packet forwarding. However, the need for these mechanisms was not formally justified. In this paper, we address the problem of whether cooperation can exist without incentive mechanisms. We propose a model,based on game theory and graph theory to investigate equilibrium conditions of packet forwarding strategies. We prove theorems about the equilibrium conditions for both cooperative and noncooperative strategies. We perform simulations to estimate the probability that the conditions for a cooperative equilibrium hold in randomly generated network scenarios.. As the problem is involved, we deliberately restrict ourselves to a static configuration. We conclude that in static ad hoc networks where the relationships between the nodes are likely to be stab le-cooperation needs to be encouraged.},

abstract={We address the problem of spectrum pricing in a cognitive radio network where multiple primary service providers compete with each other to offer spectrum access opportunities to the secondary users. By using an equilibrium pricing scheme, each of the primary service providers aims to maximize its profit under quality of service (QoS) constraint for primary users. We formulate this situation as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a consumer. The QoS degradation of the primary services is considered as the cost in offering spectrum access to the secondary users. For the secondary users, we adopt a utility function to obtain the demand function. With a Bertrand game model, we analyze the impacts of several system parameters such as spectrum substitutability and channel quality on the Nash equilibrium (i.e., equilibrium pricing adopted by the primary services). We present distributed algorithms to obtain the solution for this dynamic game. The stability of the proposed dynamic game algorithms in terms of convergence to the Nash equilibrium is studied. However, the Nash equilibrium is not efficient in the sense that the total profit of the primary service providers is not maximized. An optimal solution to gain the highest total profit can be obtained. A collusion can be established among the primary services so that they gain higher profit than that for the Nash equilibrium. However, since one or more of the primary service providers may deviate from the optimal solution, a punishment mechanism may be applied to the deviating primary service provider. A repeated game among primary service providers is formulated to show that the collusion can be maintained if all of the primary service providers are aware of this punishment mechanism, and therefore, properly weight their profits to be obtained in the future.},

abstract={"Cognitive radio" is an emerging technique to improve the utilization of radio frequency spectrum in wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum sharing among a primary user and multiple secondary users. We formulate this problem as an oligopoly market competition and use a noncooperative game to obtain the spectrum allocation for secondary users. Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. We first present the formulation of a static game for the case where all secondary users have the current information of the adopted strategies and the payoff of each other. However, this assumption may not be realistic in some cognitive radio systems. Therefore, we consider the case of bounded rationality in which the secondary users gradually and iteratively adjust their strategies based on the observations on their previous strategies. The speed of adjustment of the strategies is controlled by the learning rate. The stability condition of the dynamic behavior for this spectrum sharing scheme is investigated. The numerical results reveal the dynamics of distributed dynamic adaptation of spectrum sharing strategies.},

abstract={Recent studies on spectrum usage reveal poor utilization, both spatially and temporally. Opportunistic use of licensed spectrum while limiting interference to primary users can enhance spectrum reuse and provide orders of magnitude improvement in available channel capacity. This calls for spectrum sharing protocols that are dynamic, flexible, and efficient, in addition to being fair to end users. We employ cooperative game theory to address the opportunistic spectrum access problem. Specifically, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze a scenario in which nodes in a wireless network seek to agree on a fair and efficient allocation of spectrum. First, we show that in high interference environments, the utility space of the game is non-convex, making certain optimal allocations unachievable with pure strategies. To mitigate this, we show that as the number of channels available increases, the utility space approaches convexity, thereby making optimal allocations achievable with pure strategies. Second, by comparing and analyzing three bargaining solutions, we show that the Nash bargaining solution achieves the best tradeoff between fairness and efficiency, using a small number of channels. Finally, we develop a distributed algorithm for spectrum sharing that is general enough to accomodate non-zero disagreement points, and show that it achieves allocations reasonably close to the Nash bargaining solution.},

A specific utility function is defined considering the users' average utility per power, i.e., power unit based utility. The resource control problem is formulated as a noncooperative game, with which the properties of the Nash equilibrium of the game is investigated. Since the equilibrium is Pareto inefficient, we propose a pricing policy to the user's transmit power by adding a penalty price. With the adoption of the price, the user's aggressive behavior is depressed and Pareto improvement is achieved. Simulation results show that the proposal outperforms the pure water-filling algorithm and the users obtain higher utility and lower transmit power by proper pricing policy},

pages={1079 -1090},
abstract={In this paper, a distributive non-cooperative game is proposed to perform sub-channel assignment, adaptive modulation, and power control for multi-cell multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) networks. Each individual user's goal is to minimize his/her own transmitted power in a distributed manner under the constraints that the desirable rate is achieved and the transmitted power is bounded. The pure non-cooperative game may result in non-convergence or some undesirable Nash Equilibriums with low system and individual performances. To enhance the performances, a virtual referee is introduced to the networks and is in charge of monitoring and improving the outcome of non-cooperative competition for resources among the distributed users. If the game outcome is not desirable, either the required transmission rates should be reduced or some users should be prevented from using some radio resources such as sub-channels, so that the rest of users can share the limited resources more efficiently. Moreover, it can be shown that the introduction of the virtual referee does not increase the complexity of the networks. From the simulation results in a two-cell case, the proposed scheme reduces the transmitted power by 80% and 25% compared with the fixed channel assignment algorithm and the iterative water-filling algorithm in the literature, respectively. The achievable rate can be improved by 10%. In a multi-cell case, the proposed scheme can have up to 40% power reduction compared with the iterative water-filling algorithm when the co-channel interferences are severe.},

A detailed analysis for the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the above noncooperative game is presented. Next, a decentralized power control algorithm is developed which converges to the Nash equilibrium, as demonstrated by both analytical and simulation methods. The framework is then extended to the multicell case, making user utilities depend on base-station assignment as well as powers. We propose a generalized algorithm that can handle base station assignment and hand-off, as well as power control, and study by extensive simulations its performance in a dynamic environment.},

This situation raises the question of how to perform power control for information sources other than voice. To explore this issue, we use the concepts and mathematics of microeconomics and game theory. In this context, the quality of service of a telephone call is referred to as the ldquo;utility rdquo; and the distributed power control problem for a CDMA telephone is a ldquo;noncooperative game. rdquo; The power control algorithm corresponds to a strategy that has a locally optimum operating point referred to as a ldquo;Nash equilibrium. rdquo; The telephone power control algorithm is also ldquo;Pareto efficient, rdquo; in the terminology of game theory. When we apply the same approach to power control in wireless data transmissions, we find that the corresponding strategy, while locally optimum, is not Pareto efficient. Relative to the telephone algorithm, there are other algorithms that produce higher utility for at least one terminal, without decreasing the utility for any other terminal. This article presents one such algorithm. The algorithm includes a price function proportional to transmitter power. When terminals adjust their power levels to maximize the net utility (utility-price), they arrive at lower power levels and higher utility than they achieve when they individually strive to maximize utility},

We then analyze global convergence of continuous-time as well as discrete-time synchronous and asynchronous iterative power update algorithms to the unique NE of the game. Furthermore, we show that a stochastic version of the discrete-time update scheme, which models the uncertainty due to quantization and estimation errors, converges almost surely to the unique NE point.

abstract={A novel call admission control (CAC) scheme for an adaptive heterogeneous multimedia mobile network with multiple classes of calls is investigated here. Different classes of calls may have different bandwidth requirement, different request call holding time and different cell residence time. At any time, each cell of the network has the capability to provide service to at least a given number of calls for each class of calls. Upon the arrival (or completion or hand off) of a call, a bandwidth degrade (or upgrade) algorithm is applied. An arriving call to a cell, finding insufficient bandwidth available in this cell, may either be disconnected from the network or push another call out of the cell toward a neighboring cell with enough bandwidth. We first prove that the stationary distribution of the number of calls in the network has a product form and then show how to apply this result in deriving explicit expressions of handoff rates for each class of calls, in obtaining the disconnecting probabilities for each class of new and handoff calls, and in finding the grade of service of this mobile network},

abstract={In some exiting call admission control (CAC) schemes, perfect power control is implicitly assumed. But it is well known that in practical CDMA networks, the received power at base station (BS) is usually hard to be maintained at a fixed threshold because of fading and path loss. Therefore putting forward the CAC schemes with imperfect power control for multimedia traffic will be great significant. In this paper, the system capacity with imperfect power control and the other-cell interference factor are analyzed. And then considering the voice/video/data multimedia traffic scenario in next generation wireless network (NGWN), we propose a novel QoS based CAC scheme. The simulation results show that the system capacity is heavily affected by the imperfect power control. The proposed scheme can guarantee the QoS for different traffic efficiently, and improve the resource utility significantly},

Call admission control (CAC) is vital for these services partially due to the network's limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a call admission control framework for adaptive multimedia services in a wireless/mobile network, where the bandwidth of an ongoing call is time-varying during its lifetime. A call is degraded if the assigned bandwidth is below its request bandwidth. We introduce a new QoS parameter: degraded area size (DAS). It stands for the normalized mean product of the proportion of a calls degraded time and the degree of degradation. Based on DAS, we present a CAC model to show how to guarantee DAS. We also introduce a bandwidth reallocation algorithm to adjust calls bandwidth in a cell. Simulation results are compared with those from non adaptive multimedia services and show that the performance of our method is better},

If the desired power levels to be received at the base station for some calls are larger than the maximum allowable power limits, the admission request is rejected.

abstract={The multimedia services are getting to become the major trend in next-generation cellular networks. Call admission control (CAC) plays the key role for guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) in cellular networks. The goal which keeps both the call dropping probability (CDP) and call blocking probability (CBP) as low as possible is more difficult owing to the user indeterminate mobility. In this paper, the hidden Markov models (HMM) concept which is suitable for solving a dynamic situation is introduced and applied to the call admission control policy. The prediction of user mobility can be modeled and resolved as a decoding problem for the HMM. According to the prediction result, the proposed CAC method can reserve appropriate bandwidths for a handoff call beforehand, thus the call dropping probability is almost the same as the traditional guard channel policies that can keep lower CDP than unpredicted ones, moreover, the call blocking probability is also lower than the traditional guard channel policies since the proposed method can reserve the suitable bandwidths in the appropriate cells but not reserve a stationary ones which are always adopted by traditional CAC methods. Therefore, the proposed method can not only satisfy both CDP and CBP issues, but also improve the system utilization},

CAC (call admission control) plays an important role in the QoS guarantee of multimedia network. Noticing that many CAC schemes aim to satisfying QoS requirement and upgrading network utilization, but they ignore the fairness principle in network. Directly and simple using these CAC schemes, it will appear the phenomenon of unbalance that the narrow band calls block the broad band calls. So, this paper proposes a fair call admission control scheme by introducing call hold control. Numerical results show that the new scheme not only realizes the balancing accessing machinery to all calls, but also decrease CBP (call block probability) and improves network utilization.},

abstract={ The call admission control (CAC) belongs to the category of resource management. Since the radio spectrum is very scarce resource, CAC is one of the most important engineering issues for mobile communications. In this paper, we propose a CAC scheme for direct sequence code-division multiple-access cellular systems supporting mobile multimedia communications services. There are multiple call classes in multimedia services and the required signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) varies with call classes. Call admission decision in the proposed scheme is based on SIR measurement. We take account of the traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink, which is the most important characteristic of multimedia traffic. In addition, the proposed scheme guarantees the priority of handoff call requests over new call requests. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using Markov analysis. The performance measures which we focus on are the system throughput and the blocking probabilities of handoff calls and new calls. The outage probability of a call in progress is also calculated, which is the probability that the measured bit energy-to-noise density ratio of the call is smaller than the required value for maintaining adequate transmission quality. We present some numerical examples with practically meaningful parameter values and, as a result, show that the proposed CAC scheme can operate well in the mobile multimedia systems such as the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) systems.},

abstract={Call admission control is an effective mechanism to guarantee robust services in wireless networks. In this paper, we present several call admission control algorithms and queueing models for the subcarrier allocation in the OFDM-based wireless multimedia networks. Call connection requests are differentiated into narrow-band call and wide-band call. For either class of calls, the traffic process is characterized as batch arrival since each call may request multiple subcarriers to satisfy its quality-of- service (QoS) requirement. The batch size is a random variable following a probability mass function (pmf) with realistically maximum value. In addition, the service time for various classes are different. The formulae for the significant performance metrics call blocking probability and bandwidth utilization are developed. Numerical investigations are presented to demonstrate the interaction between key parameters and performance metrics. The performance tradeoff among different call admission control algorithms are discussed. Moreover, the analytical model has been validated by the simulation. The methodology as well as result provides an efficient tool for planning the future generation OFDM-based broadband wireless access system.},

abstract={We propose new strategies for call degradation and call admission in a third generation multimedia wireless network. Our approach is based on modeling the quality-of-service (QoS) degradation of real-time and non-real-time traffic. To increase the carried traffic in an overloaded system, some of the ongoing calls are forced to operate under a degraded mode, thereby releasing channels that they are using. Two orthogonal QoS parameters, called carried traffic and bandwidth degradation, are characterized and a cost function describing the total revenue earned by the system from a bandwidth degradation policy is formulated. This cost function model is then extended to incorporate a call admission policy. Detailed simulation experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model. When there is a mixture of real-time and non-real-time calls in the system, the real-time traffic generally has preemptive priority over the other, which are buffered for future admission in case of preemption. A channel sharing scheme is proposed for non-real-time traffic and analyzed using a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) based queueing model and by simulation experiments},

abstract={In CDMA cellular system, the coverage area of the cell is greatly influenced by soft handoff process. The variation in soft handoff coverage area can be taken as the parameter influencing the performance parameters of the CDMA cellular system. In this paper, an analytical model is developed and analyzed for the concerned target cell in CDMA cellular network. The model proposed in this paper is based on priority reservation for handoff calls along with call queuing scheme for new as well as handoff calls. Separate queues are considered for both new as well as handoff calls. Two dimensional Markov birth-death process is used for modeling the problem. The handoff queue capacity is considered as function of soft handoff coverage area which depends on the two soft handoff threshold parameters T_ADD and T_DROP. Considering fixed cell radius, variation in soft handoff coverage area also varies the normal area for new calls. It is seen that change in normal cell area is inversely proportional to soft handoff coverage area. The effect of this variation which leads to change in handoff call queue capacity along with mobility of mobile user is analyzed for variation in network performance parameters new call blocking probability, handoff request blocking probability, new and handoff call time out probabilities and forced termination probability for handoff request. Increase in handoff call queue capacity effectively decreases handoff request blocking probability but leads to increment of new call blocking probability.},

This paper proposes the 2-level call admission (2LCAC) scheme based on a call admission scheme using the priority to guarantee the consistent QoS for mobile multimedia applications. The 2LCAC consists of the basic call admission and advanced call admission; the former determines call admission based on bandwidth available in each cell and the latter determines call admission by utilizing delay tolerance time (DTT) and priority queue (PQueue) algorithms. In order to evaluate the performance of our scheme, we measure the metrics such as the blocking probability of new calls, dropping probability of handoff calls and bandwidth utilization. The result shows that the performance of our scheme is superior to that of existing schemes such as complete sharing policy (CSP), guard channel policy (GCP) and adaptive guard channel policy (AGCP).},

abstract = {A handoff control process, which can handle frequent cell-boundary crossings by mobile radio users in microcellular systems, is presented. Handoff determination criteria are investigated under microcellular propagation models. As a result, it is shown that relative field strength measurement should be applied because of its almost twice higher spectrum efficiency than that of relative distance measurement. In application, measurement frequency greatly increases due to not only cell size reduction but also microcellular propagation characteristics. In order to solve this problem, a mobile-station-originated handoff process is proposed. This process becomes feasible in a TDMA (time-division multiple-access) system because mobile stations can be easily equipped with a measurement function},
